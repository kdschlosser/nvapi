# FUNCTION NAME: NvAPI_D3D11_CreateDevice
# not DESCRIPTION: This function tries to create a DirectX 11 device. If
# the call fails (if we are running
# not    on pre-DirectX 11
# hardware), depending on the type of hardware it will try to create a DirectX 10.1 OR DirectX 10.0 +
# 
# not    OR DirectX 10.0 device. The function call is the same as
# D3D11CreateDevice(), but with an extra
# not    argument (D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL supported by the device) that the
# function fills in. This argument
# not    can contain -1 (NVAPI_DEVICE_FEATURE_LEVEL_NULL), if the
# requested featureLevel is less than DirecX 10.0.
# not
# not   NOTE: When NvAPI_D3D11_CreateDevice is called with 10+ feature
# level we have an issue on few set of
# not    tesla hardware (G80/G84/G86/G92/G94/G96) which does not support
# all feature level 10+ functionality
# not    e.g. calling driver with mismatch between RenderTarget and Depth
# Buffer. App developers should
# not    take into consideration such limitation when using NVAPI on such
# tesla hardwares.
