This is a small utility app to put your display into HDR mode and leave it there while you run other applications.
This can be useful particularly if you want to use custom shaders in an application but not modify the actual
source code to turn on HDR.

Usage:
Run switcher.exe which will make the screen black for 5 seconds while it attempts to enable HDR mode.

The black screen will go away but the application will wait for the user to press enter before sending
the display a message that is no longer sending HDR data.
